# Semantix Agent Tools

## Requirements

### Quick off

- ✅ Provide user a tool configuration class that holds all the necessary parameters to initialize a tool
- ✅ Ensure tool configuration class contains `name`, `description` by default
- ✅ Provide user a tool input class that holds the tool input schema and a method to parse the query string into the input object
- ✅ Provide user a validation decorator to perform data validation on both input and configuration fields
- ✅ Provide user a base tool class that should be the parent class of all tools
- ✅ Ensure base tool class works as a facade for the langchain base tool and contains `name` and `description` as fields

### First team suggestions

- ✅ Enable user to implement either the sync or async version of execute on a SemantixAgentTool child class
- ✅ Set a default llm on the SemantixAgentToolConfig class
- ✅ Add handlers module to be shared by multiple tools, with the required objects:
  - ✅ \_ALLOWED_MODULES
  - ✅ PythonExecutor
  - ✅ find_split_in_csv
  - ✅ find_encoding_csv
  - ✅ get_timestamp
  - ✅ get_outputfile_path
  - ✅ mount_file_url

   ignore command-line argument or add the ignore to your safety policy file.


-> Vulnerability found in restrictedpython version 6.0
   Vulnerability ID: 60840
   Affected spec: >=6.0,<6.2
   ADVISORY: RestrictedPython 6.2 and 5.4 include a fix for an
   Information Disclosure vulnerability. Python's "format" functionality
   allows someone controlling the format string to "read" all objects
   accessible through recursive attribute lookup and subscription from
   objects he can access. This can lead to critical information disclosure.
   With 'RestrictedPython', the format functionality is available via the
   'format' and 'format_map' methods of 'str' (and 'Unicode') and via
   'string.Formatter'.https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xjw2-6jm9-rf67
